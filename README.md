UntamedChat
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProxyConn/UntamedChat.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ProxyConn/UntamedChat)
<br>UntamedChat is a simple to use plugin that has support for ProxyConn and RedisBungee or standalone setups. <br>
With automatic integration UntamedChat is as easy to install as dropping a jar file in BungeeCords's plugins folder.<br><br>

Configuration
==============
If your not happy with the default formatting or behavior of UntamedChat you are able to change settings in the
[UCConfig](src/main/java/net/portalblock/untamedchat/bungee/UCConfig.java) file.
This will of course mean you will have to recompile the plugin using maven.<br><br>

Downloads
==========
Official downloads are [here](https://github.com/ProxyConn/UntamedChat/releases).

Multi-Bungee Info
==================
UntamedChat will automatically check if you are using either ProxyConn or RedisBungee, this being said I do not offer support for
RedisBungee. If you need help with that then contact the developer [here](http://minecraft.minimum.io/wiki/Support). For support
with ProxyConn please contact me or make an issue on this repository.<br>
